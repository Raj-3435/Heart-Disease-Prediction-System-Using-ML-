# Heart Disease Prediction System Using ML  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a **Machine Learning-based Heart Disease Prediction System** that analyzes patient health indicators to predict the likelihood of heart disease. By using various ML algorithms, the model aims to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and risk assessment.  

## 📂 Dataset Glimpse  
The dataset includes key medical attributes:  

| Feature   | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| age       | Age of the patient |
| sex       | Gender (1 = Male, 0 = Female) |
| cp        | Chest Pain Type (0-3) |
| trestbps  | Resting Blood Pressure (mm Hg) |
| chol      | Serum Cholesterol (mg/dl) |
| fbs       | Fasting Blood Sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = True, 0 = False) |
| restecg   | Resting Electrocardiographic Results (0-2) |
| thalach   | Maximum Heart Rate Achieved |
| exang     | Exercise-Induced Angina (1 = Yes, 0 = No) |
| oldpeak   | ST Depression Induced by Exercise |
| slope     | Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (0-2) |
| ca        | Number of Major Vessels (0-3) |
| thal      | Thalassemia Type (1-3) |
| target    | Heart Disease Presence (1 = Disease, 0 = No Disease) |


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
